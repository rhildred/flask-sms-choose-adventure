I got the user interface for the web from a student of mine, [Pat Wilken](https://patwilken.me/).

In the lab environment run this by right mousing. The first time only on setup.py.

To build your game edit Game.py in idle. Then run app.py by right mousing and clicking open. Every time you edit Game.py you will need to stop app.py by pressing ctrl-c or by closing the window. Then you will need to restart app.py even though you are changing Game.py
